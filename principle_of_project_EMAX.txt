please build a trading engine with the foillwing features:


conecct and provide connection status to mt5

provide dashbaord of last 20 orders and their pnl and usual statistics

have a button to enable ot disable trading (for the suer to select choppy period or good trending period)
button for short only long only or both enabled

add a panic button to exit all positions

perform trade on EMA crossing (fast 9 EMA slow 41 EMA)

be carefull of mutliple entry or exit during the same candle or same crossing

for sizing: i am on leverage 1000 on AXI. check this is correct for the given symbol (XAUUSD, XAGUSD, NAS100fs, US500russel, GER40, FRA40) check symbols are correct.

For now on max margin to be used from balance: 10 dollar.

add a safety SL at 50% of the margin (so for 10 dollar margin 5 dollar). (is it a good idea??)


exit on next crossing in other direction or if low of bar is very under slow EMA by ?? 0.5% 

Of course all above parameter shall be configurable in a config file and repeated on the dashbaord.

refresh the data from MT5 fast but no overflow...

add any good diea and proposal, ask me for choice, and give me any questions.

test should be done only on demo account. check for this.

Plan aslo for a backtesting on 1m time frame and 5 min time frame for 1 month.
